My portfolio is based on the simple portfolio template by [devportfoliotemplates](https://github.com/devportfoliotemplates/devportfoliotemplates). I made some edits to create my project cards from metadata, and to make reusable badges for project tech stacks. Using [SamKirkland/web-deploy](https://github.com/SamKirkland/web-deploy) for automated builds and uploads to shared hosting.
